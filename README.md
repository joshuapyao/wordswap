# WordSwap
Word Swap helps people build their vocabulary in a different language by intelligently translating select words in an article. This allows people to learn through contextual “immersion”, bringing the best possible language learning method to the user.



The main goal was to create an application that could help users practice and learn a newer language. Our vision was to create the application to be fast, intuitive, accessible, and easy to use from any device. There also was a time constraint of only a week to design and build. The team consisted of a partner and me.

# The Design Stages
We began by identifying one of the biggest issues with learning a new language: the difficulty of expanding vocabulary and knowing when to use them. To resolve this, we created an app that would translate a few contextual words from an article to a chosen language, allowing users to learn new words and also exactly when and how to use them.

To start with our design, we first thought of the user: someone who was attempting to improve their skills in a language. Seeing as both my partner and I were trying to learn a new language, we served as user personas. From then on, we brainstormed and compiled a list of needs and requirements that our application ideally should meet.

For the next design step, we storyboarded our application, thinking about how someone would use an app like ours. This led us in our interaction design and caused us to think about how to make our design accessible and seamless with everyday life.

From this we decided to create an application that would augment everyday interactions, one that would translate random words in an article to a chosen language to help users learn through immersion and context. This idea would require two APIs, one to parse given text and another to translate words.

We drew up a design of the experience, going through exactly how the user would interact with the application to achieve their goal. Then, especially due to the time constraint, we moved straight on toward programming the application. We accomplished this using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Python.

# The Final Product
Our final app would use multiple public APIs to turn this idea into realization. We coded it with mainly HTML, CSS, Python, and some JavaScript. The result was a working app that was optimized to handle any article thrown at it.

The final build worked excellently, and accomplished its goal. It ran smoothly and was quick and responsive. It provided a view of the inserted article, with highlighted words which the user could interact with to learn more. Moving forwards, an improvement that could be made would be to turn it into a browser plugin, so it could be used ubiquitously and seamlessly integrate within the daily life of a user.
